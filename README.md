# DATA STRUCTURES IN PYTHON
# INTRODUCTION
This repository provides an insightful introduction to the essential data structures in Python, such as Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples.
## Features of Data Structures
### Lists
* Ordered and mutable.
* Allows duplicate elements.
* Ideal for dynamic collections.
### Dictionaries
* Key-value pairs.
* Fast lookups.
* Keys are unique and immutable.
### Sets
* Unordered collections of unique elements.
* Ideal for membership testing and removing duplicates.
### Tuples
* Ordered and immutable.
* Useful for fixed collections of items.

# Exercises and Tasks
### List Exercises
1. Create a list of 5 random numbers and print it.
2. Insert three new values and display the updated list.
3. Use a for loop to iterate through and print each element.
### Dictionary Exercises
1. Create a dictionary with keys: name, age, address and appropriate values.
2. Add a new key-value pair: phone with a number.
### Set Exercises
1. Create a set with values 1 to 5.
2. Add the value 6 to the set.
3. Remove the value 3 from the set.
### Tuple Exercises
1. Create a tuple with values 1, 2, 3, and 4.
2. Print the length of the tuple.

# CONCLUSION
This repository serves as a practical guide to understanding and working with Python's fundamental data structures. 
Data structures are the building blocks of efficient programming, enabling the organization, storage, and retrieval of data in meaningful ways. In Python, Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples offer versatile tools for handling different types of data and scenarios.

* Lists provide flexibility for ordered and mutable data.
* Dictionaries allow quick lookups with key-value pairs, making them invaluable for mapping relationships.
* Sets offer uniqueness and efficiency for operations like union and intersection.
* Tuples ensure immutability for fixed collections.
